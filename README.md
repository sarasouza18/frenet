# frenet

Frenet coordinates are a way of representing the position on a road in a more intuitive way than traditional Cartesian coordinates (x, y).

With Frenet coordinates we can analyze and predict the behavior of a car, we use the variables s and d to describe the position of a vehicle on the road or a reference path. The coordinate s represents the longitudinal displacement and the coordinate d represents the lateral displacement.
